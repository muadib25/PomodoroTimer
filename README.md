# PomodoroTimer

<h3>ABOUT</h3>

This is a Pomodoro timer I made in Python as part of a course project.
The Pomodoro technique is a time management method. You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique.


<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
Any Linux distribution should do, since all Linux installations have Python included.<br><br>
If you are planning on running the program from source, make sure to install the <b>tkinter</b> python module.

<h3>INSTALLATION</h3>

Extract the archive in a place on your hard disk.
You can then simply run the executable.


<h3>USAGE</h3>

When the executable is run, a window pops up with a 'Start' and a 'Reset' button.
When 'Start' is clicked, the timer counts down 25 mins (the Work period), followed by 5 mins (the Break period).
This set of periods is then repeated 3 more times, the last Break being a 20 min resting period.

When each period ends the window pops up to front, followed by a system sound.
When 'Reset' is pressed, the timer stops and resets.

Enjoy!
